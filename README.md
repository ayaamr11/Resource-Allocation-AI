# Resource-Allocation-AI
 prolog program that determines whether a graph
can reach a safe state (with no deadlock) or not and if the graph can reach a
safe state, you should output the process execution order that made the
graph be in such a state. Graph data are defines as facts and
define the necessary predicates/rules that detect deadlocks
